# Frontend (React) - Quick start

This is a minimal React scaffold. For the hackathon you can either:
- Replace this with a `create-react-app` or `Vite` generated app and copy `src/` contents.
- Or run `npm init` / `npm install` then `npm start`.

Config:
- Runtime config is `public/config.json` which the app fetches at startup.
- Change `public/config.json` to toggle API endpoints without rebuilding.
